#Monty Hall problem based Statistics
This small program is implemented for the purpose to proof the Monty Hall problem using statistics.
Class MontyHall creates a simulation of the Monty Hall problem with a flexible amount of doors (the secret door will be picked randomly i.e using a random module).
As a result of program processing, an output with win-rate is given.
