# Monty Hall problem based Statistics
### About
This small program is implemented for the purpose to proof the Monty Hall problem using statistics.
Class MontyHall creates a simulation of the Monty Hall problem with a flexible amount of doors (the secret door will be picked randomly i.e using a random module).
As a result of program processing, an output with win-rate is given.

### Output example with 1 000 000 tests and 3 doors
